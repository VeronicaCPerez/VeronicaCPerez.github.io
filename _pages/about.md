I am a second-year PhD student in economics at Boston University. My research focuses on development and growth, economic history and political economy, with a strong emphasis on computational and data-driven methods. Most of my work applies machine learning and text analysis to investigate complex economic questions.

My joint work with Prof. Réka Juhász and Prof. Nathaniel Lane on <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Papers.cfm?abstract_id=4198209">measuring industrial policy</a> through text analysis has been featured in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-07-25/global-subsidy-wars-force-us-allies-to-pay-up-for-chips-evs?in_source=embedded-checkout-banner">Bloomberg</a>,<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-part-of-bidenomics-needs-more-economics-2cea1641">The Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/10/02/governments-across-the-world-are-discovering-homeland-economics">The Economist</a>, and other outlets.

Before my PhD, I earned a BSc and MA in economics from Universidad de los Andes and worked as a predoctoral fellow at the Program for Economic Research (<a href="https://econ.columbia.edu/per/">PER</a>) at Columbia University. I am originally from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monteria"> Montería</a>, Córdoba, Colombia.
