I've been working with Prof. Nathan Lane (Oxford) and Prof. Réka Juhász (UBC) as part of a research group dedicated to empirical analysis of industrial policy: state interventions that shape the composition of economic activity. With the goal to establish fundamental insights around industrial policy practice around the world.

Currently working as lab manager and I'm also co-authoring some of the research. Click on the image to check [our website](https://www.industrialpolicygroup.com)!
